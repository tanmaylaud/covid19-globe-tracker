# [COVID-19 Globe Tracker](https://tanmaylaud.github.io/covid19-globe-tracker)

## Tracking worldwide cases on an interactive 3D globe

### Designed using React and Globe.gl

#### The globe model is not mine. It is heavily inspired by covid3d.live. I have simply done a complete re-write of the project using React and added my own styling.

#### [React](https://reactjs.org) allows for better understanding of code and easier code development
